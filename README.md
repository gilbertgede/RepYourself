## About

### How we started

After the election of 2016, we asked ourselves "how can we make it easier for
all Americans to participate in democracy?" After several conversations and a
desire to make a tangible impact, Rep Yourself was born in February of 2017.
With our mission and vision realized, all Americans will have the tools at
their disposal to effectively and easily reach our elected officials.

## This Repository

This repository contains RepYourself.org's web application. It's written in
React, and the project structure was inspired by
[this repository](https://github.com/kauffecup/react-native-web-hello-world).

## The App

The web app queries our congressional database to get the information for your 
elected officials.
